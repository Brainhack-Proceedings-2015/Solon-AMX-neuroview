\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

The amount of data acquired for an fMRI experiment dimension wise is
very large and a challenge for neuroscience studies, in particular for
data analysis and visualization. Diverse tools have been developed to
confront these challenges, but their analytical results can differ.
Addressing those differences is not facilitated by existing tools. The
goal of this Brainhack project was to build a flexible utility to
analyze fMRI experimental results. This utility is called NeuroView.
NeuroView allows researchers to extend the visualizations to their
context: every visual behavior or interactions of this tool is
customizable. We implemented NeuroView to work in Web-browsers, using
JavaScript and the libraries D3.js and jQuery.

\section{Results}\label{results}

We create three tools using NeuroView to best analyze our research
results: CC200 search, SVM coefficients and Connectivity matrix. Each
tool is used to aid the analysis of results in Machine Learning tasks.
Each of these tools is described below in detail.

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\texttt{CC200 search}:}{:}}\label{section}

In this tool, we allow the user to find atlas regions (e.g.~Left Putamen
from Harvard-Oxford subcortical structural atlas) mapped to a specific
parcellation. As as initial approach, the CC200 \cite{Craddock2012}
parcellation method was used, since our analysis uses data from
functional MRI. Since we parcellate our data into CC200's ROIs in most
of our studies, the identification of atlas regions became necessary to
compare with results found in the literature. The search can be
performed in two manners: it is possible to search for an atlas region
(e.g.~Putamen) and retrieve which parcels are included in this region,
and it is possible to click an ROI in NeuroView to retrieve which atlas
regions include the specific parcel.

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\texttt{SVM coefficients}:}{:}}\label{section-1}

For the second tool, we created a user interface to identify the ROIs
that contribute to the classification in a Support Vector Machine. The
classification method uses task-based fMRI features to identify good and
poor readers \cite{Salles2013}. Given a list of most relevant features,
as shown in Figure \ref{fig:svm_coeffs}, we can show the features'
parcel in NeuroView and identify to which atlas regions this parcel
belongs to.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{figs/svm_coeffs.png}
\caption{SVM coefficients tool showing the most relevant feature in a classification task.}
\label{fig:svm_coeffs}
\end{figure}

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\texttt{Connectivity matrix}:}{:}}\label{section-2}

In the third study case, NeuroView was customized to interact with a
connectivity chord plot (or connectogram) \cite{Irimia2012}. This plot
contains each CC200 parcel and chords that represent the connectivity
between these parcels. Since we use the connectivity matrix as features
for our deep learning method, we need to check which feature (i.e.~the
correlation between two parcels) most contributes to the classification.
After thresholding 17995 features, we retrieve ten features that are
more relevant in our analysis, as shown in Figure
\ref{fig:deeplearning}. In the chord plot, a red chord indicates that
two regions are correlated, and a blue chord indicates that two regions
are anti-correlated. By clicking a chord, NeuroView highlights the
regions that are connected by this chord. Thus, highlighted regions are
correlated (or anti-correlated) given the chord color.

\end{figure}

\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}

This is an initial version of a browser-based neuroimage viewer. The
main focus is to develop an embeddable viewer, instead of a standalone
desktop software. By doing so, research results can be presented on
interactive views, enriching their analysis and interpretation. In our
case study, NeuroView facilitates quick evaluation of features for
machine learning algorithms, and promotes discussion about them, since
the results will inform researchers about their data.

In future work, we aim to directly load Nifti images at client-side and
support some AFNI features, such as voxel clustering.
